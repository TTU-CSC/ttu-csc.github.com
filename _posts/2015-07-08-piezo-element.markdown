	Piezo Element

A piezo element is a device that can act as either a speaker or a (really bad) microphone. In our labs, we use it as a simple speaker. When 5V is applied across it, the element inside moves up, and when the voltage is brought to 0V, is moves back down. If you toggle the voltage really quickly, you'll get sound out of it. The rate at which you toggle it determines the frequency.
