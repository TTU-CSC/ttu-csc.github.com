This keyword defines a long integer which is a signed number that is a minimum of 32-bits long. A 32-bit integer can hold numbers between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647. For legacy reasons, `long` is actually the same size as `int` on most platforms besides Arduino, and you have to use `long long` to get a real `long` there. On Arduino, `long` is sufficient to get an integer double the size of `int`. `long long` on Arduino will yield a 64-bit integer, which is enormous. See [Performance Considerations]({% post_url 2015-07-08-performance-considerations %}) for things you should watch out for when writing software.

It can also be used as a modifier to other data types, usually doubling their size.

Usage:

	long x = 12345678;		
	long int y = -12345678;	//can also be used in this fashion
	long double z = 1.123456;
	long long  ll = 123456;	//a very large number
