	keywords: try, catch, throw

These keywords are used in exception handling. Some code handles errors by throwing exceptions, which must be caught, or your program will crash.

Exceptions are thrown with throw. Areas that may throw exception must be in a try-catch block.

You must specify what kind of exception you want to catch, or it will not be caught. The exception is catch(...), which can catch anything.

Usage:

	try {

		//some tricky code
		throw new out_of_range();

	} catch (out_of_range &it){ 	//you must specify what kind of exeption to catch

		cerr << "On, no!" << endl;

	} catch (...){ 					//this will catch anything

		cerr << "Unknown exception!" << endl;

	}
