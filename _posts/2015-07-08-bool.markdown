	bool, true, false

`bool` is a keyword used to declare a boolean value, either true or false. Booleans are the same size as integers.
Booleans are usually used with the reserved words true and false, though integers can be used.

true and false evaluate to 1 and 0, respectively. You should, however, use the keywords when using booleans, because it makes your code more readable.

Usage:

	bool val0 = true;
	bool val2 = false;
	bool val3 = 0;		//false
	bool val4 = 1;		//true
	bool val5 = 1234;	//also true
