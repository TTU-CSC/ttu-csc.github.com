	keyword: using, namespace

This keyword is used when you want to use a namespace, or use something out of a namespace.

Namespaces are used to avoid name conflicts. Sometimes importing a whole namespace can cause a conflict, so you might only want to import one thing.

Sometimes, you have a function you want to call rename, and this lets you can do that as well.

Usage:

	using namespace std;				//use the entire STD namespace
	using CSC2100::someFunction;		//use only this function rather than the whole namespace
	using f = CSC2100::otherFunctionWithAReallyLongAnnoyingName;	//use this function, but give it a new name, because this one sucks
