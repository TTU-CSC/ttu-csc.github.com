    keywords: const_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, static_cast

These keywords are what we call casts. They tell the compiler to treat data in a different manner than normal.
Their syntax generally is:

	some_cast<type>(variable);

where something_cast is one of the below, type is a variable type, and variable is the variable to be cast.

	const_cast:			Tell the compiler to treat a variable as if it were or were not constant.
	dynamic_cast:		Determine if a cast can be made at runtime. If not, it will throw a bad_cast exception.
	reinterpret_cast:	Will cast as a value, forgetting about any type checks. 
	static_cast:		Determine if a cast can be made at compile-time. Will cause a compiler error if it cannot be made.

Generally, I recommend sticking to static_cast, because the other three are less safe and should only be used if you have a good reason for doing using them.

Usage:

    int x = 1;
    int y = 4;
     
    float xOverY = x / static_cast<float>(y); //tell the compiler to treat this a floating-point division
