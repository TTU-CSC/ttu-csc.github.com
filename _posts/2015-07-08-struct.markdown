	keyword: struct

This keyword is used to define custom user data types.

A `struct` can have any number of fields, which can be any already defined type, including primitaves, objects, and other structs. This means that a `struct` can have more than one value inside it, which is useful for almost every program. You might use a struct to represent a shipping address, which has a street address, an apartment number, a city, a state, and a zip code. Keeping up with all of that information separately in your program is dangerously error-prone, but a `struct` neatly packages it all together in one convenient package so you don't get pieces mixed up with other addresses or just lose them altogether.

Usage:

	struct MyStruct {

		int x;		//each field must have a type and name
		float y;
		char *z;

	}; //don't forget the semicolon!

	MyStruct thing; //thing is a variable of type MyStruct, rather than int or something.

	thing.x = 0;					//fields are referred to by name with the . operator
	thing.y = 1.25;
	thing.x = "This is my struct!";
