	keywords: bool, true, false

`bool` is a keyword used to declare a boolean value, either true or false. Booleans are the same size as integers.
Booleans are usually used with the reserved words true and false, though integers can be used.

true and false evaluate to 1 and 0, respectively. You should, however, use the keywords when using booleans, because it makes your code more readable.

Usage:

you can assign values directly

	bool val0 = true;
	bool val1 = false;
	bool val2 = 0;		//false
	bool val3 = 1;		//true
	bool val4 = 1234;	//also true
	bool val5 = val2;       //now equal to val2, which is false

you can also set a bool equal to the result of a comparison:

	int x = 5;
	bool xIsFive = (x == 5); //xIsFive is now true
	bool xIsTen = (x == 10); //xIsTen is now false
	bool xIsLessThanFour = (x < 4); //xIsLessThanFour is false
