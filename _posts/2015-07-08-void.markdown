	keyword: void

This keyword is used to refer to something that lacks a type, such as functions without a return value, or pointers with no size information.

A void* has the special ability for anything to be cast to it, and anything can be cast from it. Generally, that is not a good idea, unless you really know what you're doing, so we recommend just sticking to using void to represent no type at all, as it does when you say that a function returns void, when a function returns nothing at all.

Usage:

	void hello(){

		cout << "Hello" << endl;

	}

	void *x; //x has no size information with it, be very careful with these!
