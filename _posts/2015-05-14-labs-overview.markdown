Throughout the semester, there will be a variety of labs. Here, we will provide an overview of each lab.

### [Lab 1: I/O]({% post_url 2015-05-12-lab-1-IO %})  
**Purpose:** Learn how to use a microcontroller to interact with the real world, through buttons and LEDs.  
**Description:** In this lab, you will construct a simple circuit that consists of a button and two LEDs. When the button isn't being pressed, both LEDs are off. However, while the button is being pressed, one LED should stay on, and the other should blink. This shows how to use one input, a button, and two outputs.

### [Lab 2: I/O with Analog and Arithmetic]({% post_url 2015-05-14-lab-2-IO-analog %})  
**Purpose:** This lab teaches you how to deal with analog inputs.  
**Description:** Analog inputs are signals that aren't just binary, 1 or 0. These inputs cover a range of values, defined by the *voltage* being sensed at the analog input. In this lab, you will use an analog input from a potentiometer to control a piezoelectric speaker's frequency of output. You will also do some arithmetic to make the system behave in a more pleasant way.
