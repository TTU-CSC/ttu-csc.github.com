	Potentiometer

A potentiometer is device that provides a voltage that is between the high voltage going into it and the ground voltage using its center pin. This voltage can then be read using an analog port on the microcontroller to determine a continuous value such as volume or brightness. This works by having a variable resistance inside it. As the ratio of resistance between two series resistors varies, the voltage between them also varies. This is known as a voltage divider.
