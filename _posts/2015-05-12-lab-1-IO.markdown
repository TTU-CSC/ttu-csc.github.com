In this lab, you will learn the basics of how to control the real world with your code. We're going to use a button, two LEDs, and two resistors.

Connect them like this:
<Fritzing picture goes here>

The first button is connected to pin 3, LED 1 is connected to pin 4, and LED 2 is connected to pin 5.

Whenever the user is pressing the button, we want LED 1 to be on, and we want LED 2 to be blinking. Whenever the user stops pressing the button, we want both LEDs to be turned off.
