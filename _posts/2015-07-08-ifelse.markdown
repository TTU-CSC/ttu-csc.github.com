	keywords: if, else if, else

These keywords are used in decision making. They can be chained together as much as needed. The general format is:

	if (<expr>){
		//do something
	} else if (<expr>){
		//do something else
	} else {
		//do something else
	}

where <expr> is something that evaluates to a boolean, you can have as many else-if's as you want (including zero), and the else is optional.

Usage:

	int x = 5;
	if (x == 2){
		//this will execute only if x is 2
	} else if (x == 3){
		//this will execute if x is 3
		//it will not be checked if x is 2
	} else {
		//this will execute ONLY if the above do not.
	}
