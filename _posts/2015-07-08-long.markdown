	long

	unsigned long micros();

This function returns the number of microseconds since the Arduino began running the current program.
It can be used to time things even quicker than a call to millis().
Its value will reset after about 70 minutes.

Usage:

	unsigned long startTime = micros();

	//do something very quick

	unsigned long endTime = micros();

	unsigned long elapsedTime = endTime - startTime;
