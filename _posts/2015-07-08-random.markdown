	random

	long random(long max);
	long random(long min, long max);

This function returns a random number from 0 to max - 1, or between min and max.
You should call randomSeed() in setup() before using the random number generator.

Usage:	

	long randomNumber1 = random(1000); 		//randomNumber1 is somewhere between 0 and 1000.
	long randomNumber2 = random(100, 500);	//randomNumber2 is somewhere berween 100 and 500.
