It's time for another fun lab! For this lab, we're simply going to use the Arduino LCD Shield.

The goal of this lab is to build the speed game another way. The gameplay should be as follows:

- set the LCD to show some message indicating the players should wait before pushing a button.
- wait for a random amount of time (no more than 10 seconds)
- set the LCD to show an exciting message to get users to push the button (like "GO!")
- when one user presses their button after this point, the LCD should show a message indicating both that the game is over and who won.
- wait 2 seconds, then start it all over.

The only new information you need is to be able to read the buttons on the LCD shield, but if you don't remember how to set it up and write to the LCD, feel free to [review the first tutorial]({% post_url 2015-05-11-getting-started %}).

To clear the LCD screen, simply say `lcd.clear()` and `lcd.setCursor(0, 0)`.

To read the buttons, copy and paste the following code<sup>[1]</sup> at the top of your file:

    enum Keycodes : int
    {
        btnUP,
        btnDOWN,
        btnLEFT,
        btnRIGHT,
        btnSELECT,
        btnNONE
    };
    
    int read_LCD_buttons()
    {
        int adc_key_in = analogRead(0);
        if (adc_key_in > 1000) return btnNONE;
        if (adc_key_in < 50)   return btnRIGHT;  
        if (adc_key_in < 250)  return btnUP; 
        if (adc_key_in < 450)  return btnDOWN; 
        if (adc_key_in < 650)  return btnLEFT; 
        if (adc_key_in < 850)  return btnSELECT;  
        return btnNONE;
    }

then in your code you can use this function by using code similar to the following:

    int button = read_LCD_buttons();
    if (button == btnUP)
        //do something for the up button being pushed
    
and `button` will now have the keycode for the button that was pushed.

`btnUP` represents the up button, but other options include `btnDOWN`, `btnLEFT`, `btnRIGHT`, and `btnSELECT`.

I recommend using `btnLEFT` and `btnRIGHT` for the two user buttons, but you can use whichever ones seem most appropriate.

Good luck!

(Note: A 10ms delay is recommended between reads of the LCD buttons.  Without the delay, there is an error in the returned value which causes unintentional button presses.)
