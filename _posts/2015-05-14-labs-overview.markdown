Throughout the semester, there will be a variety of labs. Here, we will provide an overview of each lab.

### [Lab 0: Getting Started]({% post_url 2015-05-11-getting-started %})
**Purpose:** To get the Arduino environment set up
**Description:** Teaches you how to install the Arduino environment and use a basic program on the Arduino.

### [Lab 1: I/O]({% post_url 2015-05-12-lab-1-IO %})  
**Purpose:** Learn how to use a microcontroller to interact with the real world, through buttons and LEDs.  
**Description:** In this lab, you will construct a simple circuit that consists of a button and two LEDs. When the button isn't being pressed, both LEDs are off. However, while the button is being pressed, one LED should stay on, and the other should blink. This shows how to use one input, a button, and two outputs.

### [Lab 2: I/O with Analog and Arithmetic]({% post_url 2015-05-14-lab-2-IO-analog %})  
**Purpose:** This lab teaches you how to deal with analog inputs.  
**Description:** Analog inputs are signals that aren't just binary, 1 or 0. These inputs cover a range of values, defined by the *voltage* being sensed at the analog input. In this lab, you will use an analog input from a potentiometer to control a piezoelectric speaker's frequency of output. You will also do some arithmetic to make the system behave in a more pleasant way.

### [Lab 3: Conditional Logic]({% post_url 2015-06-01-lab-3-conditional-logic %})  
**Purpose:** Through this lab, you will learn to use more complex conditional logic effectively.  
**Description:** Conditional Logic is a tool you will use to connect different results to different limiting factors, known as conditions. *If* a user presses a button *and* a user has pressed the other button *then* we will turn on this LED.

### [Lab 4: Loops]({% post_url 2015-06-02-lab-4-loops %})  
**Purpose:** To familiarize you with a useful tool to cut down on writing the same code over and over.  
**Description:** A loop is a structure that allows you to have the same piece of code happen over and over until some condition is false. There are different kinds of loops, and this lab will show you why they are useful. 

<While button is not pressed, blink LED. For each LED, turn that LED on, then wait, then off.>
