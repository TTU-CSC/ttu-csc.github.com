In this lab, we're going to remove the piezo element and add two more LEDs, for a total of three LEDs.

When writing software, there innumerable times when you need to do a certain action more than once. Copying and pasting code is a direct violation of the [DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself), and WET solutions (We Enjoy Typing) make code that is both difficult to understand and maintain.

One of the fundamental tools used to avoid WET solutions is the loop. There are three major kinds of loops in C++: `for`, `while`, and `do..while`. Combining these three will allow you to minimize repetition. Here is an example of each:

	int x = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= 10; i++)
    {
    	x = x * i;
    }
    //x is 10 factorial.

    int x = 244;
    while (x - 3 > 8)
    {
    	x = x / 2;
    }
    //x is now 7, and `7 - 3` = `4` which is less than `8`, therefore the while loop stopped looping.
