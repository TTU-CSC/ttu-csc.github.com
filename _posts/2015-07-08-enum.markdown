	keyword: enum

This keyword is used to create an enumerated data type. In other words, you're giving names to integers.

You can specify an enum's type if you want. If you don't they will be of type int by default.
You can also specify the values. If you don't the compiler will pick them for you, usually starting at 0 and going upwards.

Usage:

	enum MyEnum0 { ZERO, ONE, TWO };			//default int from zero
	enum MyEnum2 : char { A = 'a', B = 'b' };	//this one is a char, and I'm specifying values
