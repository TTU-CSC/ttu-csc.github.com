	keyword: enum

This keyword is used to create an enumerated data type. In other words, you're giving names to integers.

You can specify an enum's type if you want. If you don't they will be of type int by default.
You can also specify the values. If you don't the compiler will pick them for you, usually starting at 0 and going upwards.

Enumerated types can be returned from functions, used as function arguments, and be declared as variables.

Usage:

	enum MyEnum0 { ZERO, ONE, TWO };			//default int from zero
	enum MyEnum2 : char { A = 'a', B = 'b' };	//this one is a char, and I'm specifying values

	MyEnum0 exampleFunction(MyEnum2 arg);		//this function returns a MyEnum0, and takes one MyEnum2 as an argument

	MyEnum0 x = ZERO;							//x is of type MyEnum0, and is initialized to the value ZERO

	MyEnym2 y = exampleFunction(x);				//y is of type MyEnum2, and is set equal to the result of that function call.
