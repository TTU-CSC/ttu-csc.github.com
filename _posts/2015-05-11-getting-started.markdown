To get started with Arduino, you need to download and install the Arduino IDE.

1. [Download it from here][ArduinoIDE]
2. Install it like any other application for your operating system.
3. If you're using Windows, you will need to follow [these instructions][Instructions] to install additional drivers.

Now that the Arduino IDE is installed, it is time to make sure everything is working.
1. Open the IDE
2. Go to File -> Examples -> 01.Basics -> Blink
3. Click the button in the toolbar that looks like an arrow facing to the right.

If your Arduino IDE is configured correctly and your Arduino is plugged in, you should have an LED blinking on it now.
