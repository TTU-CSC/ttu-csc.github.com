	GPIO

GPIO stands for General Purpose Input/Output. The GPIO pins on an [AVR MCU](% post_url 2015-07-08-avr-mcu %) allow you to receive (input) and send (output) logical ones and zeros. These logic values are represented by 5 volts (5V) for a one and 0 volts (0V) for a zero. These pins are accessible through the headers on the Arduino, where you can plug wires in.
