	keyword: return

This keyword is used to return a value from a function back to its caller. 

All functions that return a type other than void must have a `return` statement in them.

The `return` keyword can be used to exit a void function early if desired.

Usage:

	int add(int a, int b) {
		return a + b; //compiler will get mad at me if I do not have a return, since I told it I would be returning an int!
	}

	void hello() {
		cout << "Hello" << endl;
		//no return needed
	}

	void helloIfTrue(bool val) {
		if (!val) {
			return; //you can exit early from a void function if you want.
		} 
		cout << "Hello" << endl;
	}
