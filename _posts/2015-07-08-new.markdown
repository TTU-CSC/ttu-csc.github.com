	keywords: new, new [], delete, delete []

These keywords are used to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory.

If you allocate memory with `new`, you MUST deallocate it with `delete`. Failing to do so can cause one of the worst kinds of bugs, known as memory leaks, and on an Arduino that has bare kilobytes of RAM, a memory leak will cause the Arduino to crash very quickly, and you won't get a message telling you that it crashed. It will just be in a crashed state, doing nothing at all, until you reset it.

`new[]` and `delete[]` are used for allocating and deallocating arrays. Same rules apply with them, just make sure to only use `delete[]` with `new[]` and `delete` with `new`... mix and match is not a good idea.

Usage:

	int *x = new int; 	//make me a new integer;
	*x = 5;				//x points to an integer, which is 5.
	delete x;			//x points to the same spot, but it has been freed

	x = new int[5];		//now x points to an array of five integers

	delete [] x;		//x points to the same spot, but all 5 slots have been freed.
